a) Explain the subnet and use the NMAP Command to scan the services for the whole subnet.

Ans : To scan the services for the whole subnet, you can use the following 
NMAP command: nmap -sV <subnet_address>/24
This will scan all the hosts in the subnet, and use the -sV flag to detect the version of the services running on each host.
The "/24" at the end of the subnet address specifies the subnet mask, indicating that the scan should include all hosts within the same Class C network.


b) What is a firewall andmention its types. Use the NMAP command to detect that a firewall protects the host.
