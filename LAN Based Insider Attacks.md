Make use of Ettercap/arpspoof tool to perform ARP Cache Poisoning based attacks in a LAN environment: 

1.Perform Password stealing (over plaintext) using ARP Cache Poisoning attacks.

Ans: Arp means Address Resolution Protocol.ARP Cache Poisoning is a type of attack where an attacker sends fake Address Resolution Protocol messages to a local network.
These messages are used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a network.
An attacker can use ARP Cache Poisoning to modify the ARP tables of a victim's computer and redirect its network traffic to the attacker's machine.
In the case of password stealing, the attacker can use ARP Cache Poisoning to intercept the victim's login credentials. 
When a victim tries to log in to a website or service, the victim's computer sends the login credentials over the network in plaintext. 
The attacker can intercept these plaintext credentials using ARP Cache Poisoning and use them to log in to the victim's account.
Here Iam using ettercap tool to perform ARP poisoning.
Ettercap and arpspoof are two tools commonly used for ARP Cache Poisoning attacks.
Ettercap is a network security tool that allows the user to sniff and intercept network traffic. 
It can be used to perform ARP Cache Poisoning attacks, and it supports various plugins for password sniffing, including HTTP, FTP, and Telnet.
Arpspoof is a simple command-line tool that can be used to redirect network traffic to the attacker's machine.

To perform ARP Cache Poisoning and password stealing using these tools, the attacker needs to follow the steps:

Identify the victim's IP address and MAC address.
Use arpspoof to redirect the victim's network traffic to the attacker's machine.
Use Ettercap to sniff the network traffic and intercept the victim's login credentials.
Use the stolen credentials to log in to the victim's account.

2.Perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using ARP Cache Poisoning attacks 
3.Perform DNS Spoofing attack using ARP Cache Poisoning attacks 
4.Invoke ‘sslstrip tool’ for stealing passwordsfrom any machine that is connected toa LAN by stripping the HTTPSconnection.
5.Use arp_cop and scan_poisoner plugins to learn about the detection of ARP attacks.
6.Observe the ARP cache table, CAM table, etc., before and after the attack for all the above attacks.
Run Wireshark and observe the traffic patternsbefore and after the attack
