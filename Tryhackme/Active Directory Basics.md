**Task 1 : Introduction**

Microsoft's Active Directory is the backbone of the corporate world. 
It simplifies the management of devices and users within a corporate environment.

**Task 2 : Windows Domains**

1. Initially, managing a small business network with five computers and five employees is relatively simple, with the ability to configure each computer separately.
2. As the business grows to 157 computers and 320 users across multiple offices, manual management becomes impractical and inefficient.
3. To overcome these limitations, a Windows domain is used, which is a group of users and computers under the administration of a business.
4. The main component of a Windows domain is Active Directory (AD), which serves as a central repository for network administration.
5. A Domain Controller (DC) is the server that runs Active Directory services.
6. Benefits of a configured Windows domain include centralised identity management and the ability to manage security policies across the network.
7. A real-world example of a Windows domain is seen in school or university networks, where users can access any computer using their credentials, which are verified by Active Directory.
8. Active Directory allows for the enforcement of policies, such as restricting access to certain features or granting administrative privileges.
9. The task at hand is to review and make additional configurations to the "THM.local" domain as the new IT admin at THM Inc. Administrative credentials will be provided for a pre-configured Domain Controller (DC) to perform the tasks.

Ans: Active Directory

Q: The server in charge of running the Active Directory services is called…
