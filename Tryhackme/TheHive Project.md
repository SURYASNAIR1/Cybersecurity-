**Task 1  Room Outline**

This room will cover the foundations of using the TheHive Project, a Security Incident Response Platform.

**Task 2  Introduction**

TheHive Project operates under the guide of three core functions:

* Collaborate: Multiple analysts from one organization can work together on the same case simultaneously. Through its live stream capabilities, everyone can keep an eye on the cases in real time.
* Elaborate: Investigations correspond to cases. The details of each case can be broken down into associated tasks, which can be created from scratch or through a template engine. Additionally, analysts can record their progress, attach artifacts of evidence and assign tasks effortlessly.
* Act: A quick triaging process can be supported by allowing analysts to add observables to their cases, leveraging tags, flagging IOCs and identifying previously seen observables to feed their threat intelligence.

* **Task 3  TheHive Features & Integrations**

Q:  Which open-source platform supports the analysis of observables within TheHive?

Ans : Cortex

**Task 4  User Profiles & Permissions**

Q: Which pre-configured account cannot manage any cases?

Ans :admin

Q: Which permission allows a user to create, update or delete observables?

Ans : manageobservable

Q : Which permission allows a user to execute actions?

Ans : manageAction

**Task 5  Analyst Interface Navigation**

**Task 6 Conclusion**

Grasp on how incident response and management is performed using TheHive and give you a working knowledge of the tool.
