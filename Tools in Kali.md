1.Information Gathering 
Information gathering is an important part of Ethical Hacking, where penetration testers or hackers try to gather more information about the target to increase the probability of a successful attack. It is a method used by analysts to determine the needs of customers and users, and tools such as Whois, nslookup can help hackers gather user information.

a.DNS Analysis 
DNS or Domain Name System analysis is the process of examining the DNS infrastructure of a target domain or network to gather information about its DNS servers, subdomains, and other related information.
i.	      dnsenum : 
⦁	DNSenum is a tool available in Kali Linux used for enumerating DNS information about a domain. It can be used to identify DNS servers, DNS zone transfers, and email servers associated with a domain.
⦁	The tool performs a series of DNS queries to retrieve information about the domain, such as its IP addresses, subdomains, and email addresses. It uses a combination of DNS queries and other techniques to gather this information.
⦁	DNSenum can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities associated with a domain. For example, it can identify misconfigured DNS servers or weak email server configurations that could be exploited by attackers.
⦁	The tool is highly customizable and allows users to specify various options and parameters, such as the type of DNS queries to perform, the timeout for queries, and the output format. The output can be saved in various formats, including text, CSV, and XML.
⦁	DNSenum is a powerful tool that can be used for reconnaissance and information gathering during penetration testing or vulnerability assessments. However, it should be used responsibly and with the owner's permission, as it can be used to gather sensitive information about a domain.
