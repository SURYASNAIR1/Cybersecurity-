**Assignment Topic: Security Assessment of Wi-Fi**


Wi-Fi, short for wireless fidelity, is a technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or other networks without the need for wires or cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices and a wireless access point, which is connected to the internet or a network.Wi-Fi is the most widely used wireless technology that connects devices to the internet or other networks.Wi-Fi networks are susceptible to security vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches and other security incidents. Therefore, conducting a security assessment of Wi-Fi networks is essential to identify potential vulnerabilities and protect against security threats.

1.Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it. 

Ans: Wi-Fi works by using radio waves to transmit data between devices and a wireless access point, which is connected to the internet or a network. The access point acts as a central hub that allows devices to connect to the network and communicate with each other.When a device wants to connect to a Wi-Fi network, it sends a request to the access point. The access point then assigns the device an IP address and allows it to communicate with other devices on the network.The data that is transmitted between devices and the access point is encrypted using various security protocols, such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2. Encryption helps to protect the data from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.Wi-Fi networks can operate in different frequency bands, such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The frequency band determines the range and speed of the network. For example, 2.4 GHz networks have a longer range but a slower data transfer rate, while 5 GHz networks have a shorter range but a faster data transfer rate.Overall, Wi-Fi provides a convenient and flexible way to connect devices to the internet or a network without the need for wires or cables.

2.Perform Wi-Fi fingerprinting using Wigile, Inssider, and Kismet.

3.CreateanAccess pointwith any Wi-Fi encryption standard and start testingthe security of that connectionusing any Wi-Fi security testing tools,which should include (Aircrack-Ng, Wifite, not limited).Try to capture the 4-wayhandshake using these methods.

4.After capturing the required filesfortesting, usedictionarygeneration and password cracking tools to crack the Wi-Fi password.

a.You mustuse an existing word file to crack the password.

b.Also you have to create your dictionaryfilefor cracking the passwords.

c.Keep 3 different types of passwordsforyour Wi-Fi to test it. Simple, medium,and complex passwords can be used for testing. Simple can be a dictionary word, medium can be of dictionaryword with some numbers, and complex can be generated from any password generatoronline.

5.UseRouge AP (WifiPhisher) to create anEvil twin, perform a basic phishing attack using this rouge AP,anddocumentthe difference between the two attacks you have performed.

6.Learn the protocol level working of WPA3 and how it differsfrom WPA2.
