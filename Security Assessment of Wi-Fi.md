**Assignment Topic: Security Assessment of Wi-Fi**


Wi-Fi, short for wireless fidelity, is a technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or other networks without the need for wires or cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices and a wireless access point, which is connected to the internet or a network.Wi-Fi is the most widely used wireless technology that connects devices to the internet or other networks.Wi-Fi networks are susceptible to security vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches and other security incidents. Therefore, conducting a security assessment of Wi-Fi networks is essential to identify potential vulnerabilities and protect against security threats.

1.Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it. 

Ans : Wi-Fi works by using radio waves to transmit data between devices and a wireless access point, which is connected to the internet or a network. The access point acts as a central hub that allows devices to connect to the network and communicate with each other.When a device wants to connect to a Wi-Fi network, it sends a request to the access point. The access point then assigns the device an IP address and allows it to communicate with other devices on the network.The data that is transmitted between devices and the access point is encrypted using various security protocols, such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2. Encryption helps to protect the data from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.Wi-Fi networks can operate in different frequency bands, such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The frequency band determines the range and speed of the network. For example, 2.4 GHz networks have a longer range but a slower data transfer rate, while 5 GHz networks have a shorter range but a faster data transfer rate.Overall, Wi-Fi provides a convenient and flexible way to connect devices to the internet or a network without the need for wires or cables.

Types of Wi-Fi networks:

**a.Public Wi-Fi**: This type of Wi-Fi network is available in public places such as coffee shops, airports, and hotels, and can be accessed by anyone. It is typically unsecured, which means that it is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to attacks.

**b.Private Wi-Fi**: This type of Wi-Fi network is typically used in homes and businesses, and is secured using a password or other authentication methods.

**c.Guest Wi-Fi**: This type of Wi-Fi network is often set up in businesses to allow visitors to connect to the internet without having access to the business's main network.

Types of Wi-Fi attacks:

**a.Eavesdropping**: This attack involves intercepting Wi-Fi traffic to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data.

**b.Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**: This attack involves intercepting and modifying Wi-Fi traffic to gain access to sensitive information.

**c.Rogue access point**: This attack involves setting up a fake Wi-Fi network to trick users into connecting to it and stealing their data.

**d.Denial-of-service (DoS) attack**: This attack involves overwhelming a Wi-Fi network with traffic to disrupt its normal operation.

**e.Password cracking**: This attack involves using software to guess or crack the Wi-Fi network's password and gain access to the network.

**f.Packet injection**: This attack involves injecting malicious packets into a Wi-Fi network to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.


2.Perform Wi-Fi fingerprinting using Wigile, Inssider, and Kismet.

Ans : 

3.CreateanAccess pointwith any Wi-Fi encryption standard and start testingthe security of that connectionusing any Wi-Fi security testing tools,which should include (Aircrack-Ng, Wifite, not limited).Try to capture the 4-wayhandshake using these methods.

Ans : 

4.After capturing the required filesfortesting, usedictionarygeneration and password cracking tools to crack the Wi-Fi password.

a.You mustuse an existing word file to crack the password.

Ans : 

b.Also you have to create your dictionaryfilefor cracking the passwords.

Ans : 

c.Keep 3 different types of passwordsforyour Wi-Fi to test it. Simple, medium,and complex passwords can be used for testing. Simple can be a dictionary word, medium can be of dictionaryword with some numbers, and complex can be generated from any password generatoronline.

Ans : 

5.UseRouge AP (WifiPhisher) to create anEvil twin, perform a basic phishing attack using this rouge AP,anddocumentthe difference between the two attacks you have performed.

Ans : 

6.Learn the protocol level working of WPA3 and how it differsfrom WPA2.

Ans :
