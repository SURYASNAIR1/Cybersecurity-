**Assignment Topic: Security Assessment of Wi-Fi**


Wi-Fi, short for wireless fidelity, is a technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or other networks without the need for wires or cables. It uses radio waves to transmit data between devices and a wireless access point, which is connected to the internet or a network.Wi-Fi is the most widely used wireless technology that connects devices to the internet or other networks.Wi-Fi networks are susceptible to security vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches and other security incidents. Therefore, conducting a security assessment of Wi-Fi networks is essential to identify potential vulnerabilities and protect against security threats.

1.Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it. 

2.Perform Wi-Fi fingerprinting using Wigile, Inssider, and Kismet.

3.CreateanAccess pointwith any Wi-Fi encryption standard and start testingthe security of that connectionusing any Wi-Fi security testing tools,which should include (Aircrack-Ng, Wifite, not limited).Try to capture the 4-wayhandshake using these methods.

4.After capturing the required filesfortesting, usedictionarygeneration and password cracking tools to crack the Wi-Fi password.

a.You mustuse an existing word file to crack the password.

b.Also you have to create your dictionaryfilefor cracking the passwords.

c.Keep 3 different types of passwordsforyour Wi-Fi to test it. Simple, medium,and complex passwords can be used for testing. Simple can be a dictionary word, medium can be of dictionaryword with some numbers, and complex can be generated from any password generatoronline.

5.UseRouge AP (WifiPhisher) to create anEvil twin, perform a basic phishing attack using this rouge AP,anddocumentthe difference between the two attacks you have performed.

6.Learn the protocol level working of WPA3 and how it differsfrom WPA2.
